### Jira Issue Not Detected
- Branch Naming Convention: Make sure your branch names include the Jira issue number.
- Issue Regex: If you have a custom branch naming convention, adjust the issue_regex input accordingly.

- GITHUB_TOKEN: Ensure that the GITHUB_TOKEN is correctly referenced and has the necessary permissions.
- Repository Permissions: Verify that you have write access to the repository.
### Still Having Problems?
- Check Action Logs: Go to the "Actions" tab in your repository to view logs and error messages.
